# **Multi-Source-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization-with-Power-BI**

In this project, I embarked on the task of gathering data from three distinct sources: customers, products, and sales orders from different years. Using Excel and Power Query, I combined these sources through the append process. The subsequent analysis focused on sales data and average shipping times across various factors, including product category, subcategory, client segment, state, and shipping mode. The project was brought to life with a Power BI dashboard that visualizes and communicates the findings effectively.

**Key Features:**
- **Data Integration:** Seamless integration of data from multiple sources, providing a comprehensive dataset for analysis.
- **Multi-Factor Analysis:** In-depth examination of sales and shipping metrics based on a variety of key factors.
- **Power BI Dashboard:** Creation of an interactive and informative Power BI dashboard to illustrate the project's insights.

**What to Expect:**
- Comprehensive insights into sales and shipping trends, offering valuable data-driven decision support.
- User-friendly data visualization in the Power BI dashboard, enabling clear communication of complex findings.
- A demonstration of data integration and analysis expertise applicable to business intelligence and data-driven decision-making.

This project showcases the power of data integration, analysis, and visualization. Whether you're involved in sales, logistics, or data analytics, the insights gained here will prove invaluable for understanding and optimizing your business operations.
